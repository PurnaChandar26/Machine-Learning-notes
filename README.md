## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an agent interacts with an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. These notes cover various aspects of RL, including:

- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)

- Q-Learning

- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

- Policy Gradients

- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

- Reinforcement Learning in Robotics

- And much more!

Explore the [Reinforcement Learning](./Reinforcement%20Learning) section for in-depth insights and practical examples.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with multiple layers, known as deep neural networks. This section of the repository delves into topics such as:

- Neural Network Architectures

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

- Transfer Learning

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

- Deep Learning Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

- And more!

Visit the [Deep Learning](./Deep%20Learning) section to explore these topics and find valuable resources for building and training deep learning models.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are the building blocks of deep learning. In this section, we cover the fundamentals of ANNs, including:

- Perceptrons and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)

- Activation Functions

- Backpropagation

- Regularization techniques

- Hyperparameter tuning

- Practical tips for building effective ANNs

- And much more!
